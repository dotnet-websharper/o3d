% Overview

This WebSharper™ Extension provides a set of classes and functions almost
identical to the ones documented in the [O3D API][o3d-api]. When used
in WebSharper™ projects, these stub classes delegate the work to the
actual classes implemented by the browser.

After adding the reference to the project all the classes can be found
under the `IntelliFactory.WebSharper.O3D` module.

The O3D WebSharper Extension is as far as possible a one-to-one
mapping of O3D. Therefore, a description of the O3D pipeline and
the structure of an O3D program are beyond the scope of this manual.
We recommend to have a look at online resources such as
[the O3D developer's guide][o3d-devguide] for such information. Instead, we
present here the differences and subtleties between the extension
and the JavaScript API.

O3D exists in two forms: a plugin for Google Chrome, and a JavaScript API
on top of WebGL. The Chrome plugin has been deprecated by Google in May 2010;
therefore, although the WebSharper™ extension includes complete functionality
for both backends, this documentation assumes that WebGL is used.
