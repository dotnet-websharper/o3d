% Overview

This WebSharper™ Extension provides a set of classes and functions almost
identical to the ones documented in the [WebGL API][webgl-api]. When used
in WebSharper™ projects, these stub classes delegate the work to the
actual classes implemented by the browser.

After adding the reference to the project all the classes can be found
under the `IntelliFactory.WebSharper.WebGL` module.

The WebGL WebSharper Extension is as far as possible a one-to-one
mapping of WebGL. Therefore, a description of the WebGL pipeline and
the structure of a WebGL program are beyond the scope of this manual.
We recommend to have a look at online resources such as
[Learning WebGL][learning-webgl] for such information. Instead, we
present here the differences and subtleties between the extension
and the JavaScript API.
